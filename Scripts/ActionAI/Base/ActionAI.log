[x] [DATE: 11/14/2020 (mm/dd/yyyy)] [CODE DEVELOPED BY: zerodowned]

[i] "AI_ActionAI" should never be assigned to any mobile that wasn't designed for the ActionAI mobile 
    system; doing could cause your server to crash unexpectedly (*you have been warned*)

>>> [✔] Added ActionAI.cs
         • this new AIType brings NPCs to life by making them do the jobs they chose for their 
           profession; that means fishers (fish), lumberjacks (chop trees), miners (dig and excavate).
         • in addition this new AI brings a new Pirate system and introduces wandering Caravans;
           these caravans are vendors who walk from city to city and sell goods to players
