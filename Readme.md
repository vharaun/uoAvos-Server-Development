## uoAvos-Development - `Official Release` <div align="Right">Last Updated: 04/15/2022</div>

>**What's With The New RunUO Emulator?!**
- While we are using RunUO_v2.7 as our foundation for the server, the overall goal is to change the emulator so that we can use the Ultima Online™ (UO™) game engine to create new genres of games while maintaining the same view aspect ratio as UO™; this has all been made possible using a customized game client provided to us by **<a href="http://www.classicuo.eu" target="_blank">ClassicUO</a>** and the support of the Ultima Online™ emulation community.

>**Who Should Download This Repository?**
- That is entirely decided on a case-by-case basis, and is really just a matter of preference. If you prefer the *original style* directory and file structure, then stick with RunUO_v2.7. However if you want a *fresh start* at making a server, and you can handle a learning curve, then maybe this repository might suit you better.

>**Why Did You Create This Repository??**
- This repository was created to be the foundation for ALL future uoAvocation server project(s); it will remain a permanent backup for our development team to fall back on.

>**What To Expect Using This Repository?**
- The first thing everyone should understand is that this repository was designed to be generic; it follows where creativity leads. This project is for true custom game servers and therefore DOES NOT follow the *RunUO/ ServUO/ ModernUO* standard of Ultima Online™ emulation. What this means is that we are not an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Origin_Systems" target="_blank">"OSI"</a> accurate emulator and have no plans to keep our project in sync with modifications, past or present, made by Broadsword™ to the Ultima Online™ game.
